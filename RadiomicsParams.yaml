# This is an example of a parameters file
# It is written according to the YAML-convention (www.yaml.org) and is checked by the 提取特征 for consistency.
# Three types of parameters are possible and reflected in the structure of the document:
#
# Parameter category:
#   Setting Name: <value>
#
# The three parameter categories are:
# - setting: Setting to use for preprocessing and class specific settings. if no <value> is specified, the value for
#   this setting is set to None.
# - featureClass: Feature class to enable, <value> is list of strings representing enabled features. If no <value> is
#   specified or <value> is an empty list ('[]'), all features for this class are enabled.
# - imageType: image types to calculate features on. <value> is custom kwarg settings (dictionary). if <value> is an
#   empty dictionary ('{}'), no custom settings are added for this input image.
#
# Some parameters have a limited list of possible values. Where this is the case, possible values are listed in the
# package documentation

# Settings to use, possible settings are listed in the documentation (section "Customizing the extraction").
setting:
  #binWidth: 50
  binCount: 20
  label: 1
  interpolator: 'sitkBSpline' # This is an enumerated value, here None is not allowed
  resampledPixelSpacing: # This disables resampling, as it is interpreted as None, to enable it, specify spacing in x, y, z as [x, y , z]
  weightingNorm: # If no value is specified, it is interpreted as None
  geometryTolerance: 0.01  #img
  normalize: False
  force2D: True
  resegmentRange: [0,0.995]
  resegmentMode: "relative"

# Image types to use: "Original" for unfiltered image, for possible filters, see documentation.
imageType:
  Original: {}
  LoG: # If the in-plane spacing is large (> 2mm), consider removing sigma value 1.
    sigma: [1.0, 3.0, 5.0]
  Wavelet:
    level: 2
  
# Featureclasses, from which features must be calculated. If a featureclass is not mentioned, no features are calculated
# for that class. Otherwise, the specified features are calculated, or, if none are specified, all are calculated.
featureClass:
  shape:  # disable redundant Compactness 1 and Compactness 2 features by specifying all other shape features

  glcm:
  glrlm: # for lists none values are allowed, in this case, all features are enabled
